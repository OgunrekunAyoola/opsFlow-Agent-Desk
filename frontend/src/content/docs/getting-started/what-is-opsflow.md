# What is OpsFlow?

OpsFlow is a customer operations platform that combines tickets, AI triage, and team workflows.
Instead of replacing every tool you already use, OpsFlow sits around your existing stack and
gives you a single, consistent way to see and act on customer issues.

## Why teams use OpsFlow

- Centralise customer issues that currently live in email, chat, and internal tools.
- Add AI triage and suggested replies without rewriting your support stack.
- Give leadership a clear view of volume, sentiment, and risk across accounts.

## Core ideas

- **Tickets**: every support request becomes a ticket with subject, body, customer, and status.
- **AI triage**: tickets are automatically categorised, prioritised, and summarised.
- **Auto‑reply**: for “safe” categories, OpsFlow can draft and optionally send replies.
- **Teams and roles**: admins configure the workspace, agents work the ticket queue.

## Where OpsFlow fits

OpsFlow is usually connected to:

- your support inbox (email forwarding)
- your app or backend (API‑driven tickets)
- your CRM or helpdesk (optional mirroring)

This lets you keep using tools you already like, while adding a modern AI‑driven layer on top.
