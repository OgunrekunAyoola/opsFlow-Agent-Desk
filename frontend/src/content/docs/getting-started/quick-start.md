# Quick Start Guide

This guide gets you from “no workspace” to “AI‑triaged tickets” in a few minutes.

## 1. Create your workspace

1. Open the OpsFlow signup page.
2. Enter your workspace name, your name, email, and a strong password.
3. Check your inbox and click the verification link.

Once verified, you land in the dashboard for your new tenant.

## 2. Invite your team

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar.
2. Invite at least one other admin and one agent.
3. Ask them to accept the invitation and log in.

Agents see the ticket queue; admins can also change workspace settings.

## 3. Connect email

1. Go to **Settings → Email**.
2. Copy your tenant’s inbound email address.
3. Follow the **Email Forwarding Setup** guide for Gmail or Outlook.

When forwarding is configured, any message to your support address becomes a ticket.

## 4. Create your first ticket

- Send a test email from a personal account to your support address.
- Wait a few seconds, then open **Tickets**.
- You should see a new ticket with subject and body from the email.

## 5. Run AI triage

1. Open the ticket.
2. Use the AI panel to run triage.
3. Review the suggested category, priority, summary, and reply.

You now have a realistic OpsFlow environment ready for deeper configuration.
