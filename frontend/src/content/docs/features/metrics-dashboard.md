# Metrics Dashboard

The metrics dashboard gives you a high-level view of:

- ticket volume over time
- status breakdown (new, in progress, resolved)
- priority distribution
- team activity

## Typical questions you can answer

- How many new tickets did we get this week?
- How many are high or urgent priority?
- Are we closing more tickets than we are opening?

## Using the dashboard

- Use date range controls to focus on a specific period.
- Combine sentiment and priority to spot risky accounts.
- Share screenshots with leadership for quick updates.
