# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis assigns a tone label to each ticket:

- positive
- neutral
- negative

## Why it matters

Sentiment helps you:

- spot at-risk accounts earlier
- prioritise negative conversations when queues are long
- report on changes in customer mood over time

## Using sentiment in the UI

- In the ticket list, use filters to focus on negative sentiment.
- On the dashboard, monitor how sentiment trends by day or week.
