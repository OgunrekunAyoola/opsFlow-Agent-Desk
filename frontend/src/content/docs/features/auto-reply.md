# Auto-Reply System

Auto-reply lets OpsFlow send AI-generated responses for tickets that meet conditions you control.

## When to use auto-reply

Auto-reply is ideal for:

- common “how do I…” questions
- simple billing or account status requests
- low-risk updates (confirmation emails, status pings)

## Configuration

Go to **Settings → Auto-reply** and choose:

- which ticket categories are safe for auto-reply
- the minimum AI confidence threshold

OpsFlow will only send an auto-reply when both category and confidence rules are satisfied.

## Review and override

Even when auto-reply is enabled, agents can:

- see the AI draft in the ticket’s AI panel
- send an edited version if needed
- disable auto-reply for individual tickets by adjusting settings
