# Team Management

Team management controls who can access your OpsFlow workspace and what they can do.

## Roles

- **Admin** – manage settings, invite users, see everything.
- **Member** – work tickets assigned to them or their queues.

## Inviting users

1. Go to the **Team** page.
2. Click **Invite teammate**.
3. Enter their name, email, and choose a role.
4. Send the invite and ask them to accept via email.

## Best practices

- Keep at least two admins for redundancy.
- Use member roles for day-to-day agents.
- Remove access when people leave the company.
