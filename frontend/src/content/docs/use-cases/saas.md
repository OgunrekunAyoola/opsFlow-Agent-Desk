# OpsFlow for SaaS Companies

SaaS support traffic often mixes product questions, incidents, and billing issues. OpsFlow can:

- highlight negative sentiment from key accounts
- route incidents to the right on-call or product team
- separate “how to” questions from genuine bugs

Examples:

- classify tickets by feature area
- flag “can’t log in” and payment failures as urgent
- share a filtered view of tickets with account managers

This helps reduce churn and improves collaboration between support, product, and sales.
