# OpsFlow for E-commerce

E-commerce teams handle high volume, repeatable questions. OpsFlow helps by:

- automatically tagging orders, shipping, and returns issues
- prioritising VIP and high-value customers
- drafting replies to common questions

Common flows:

- order status updates
- refund and return requests
- address changes before shipment

Use AI triage to route risky cases (refunds, chargebacks) to specialised teams.
