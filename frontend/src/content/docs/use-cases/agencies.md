# OpsFlow for Agencies

Agencies juggle multiple clients and brands at once. OpsFlow helps by:

- separating tickets by client or brand
- prioritising work by SLA or campaign importance
- giving account managers a clear view of open issues

Suggested setup:

- use clients in OpsFlow to represent brands or end customers
- ensure tickets are tagged with the correct client
- share filtered views with internal teams and client stakeholders
